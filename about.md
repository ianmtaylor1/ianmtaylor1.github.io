![Me](assets/me.jpg)

I am a PhD student in statistics at Colorado State University (since 2017).
I have a degree in math from Clemson University. After Clemson, I was a 
strategy analyst and senior analyst for CarMax Auto Finance.

When I'm not working, I like weightlifting, computer projects, hiking, and 
listening to podcasts. Coffee and beer enthusiast.

### About this site

I'm kind of intimidated by writing, which is not a great thing for a grad
student to be. My hope is that by giving myself a low pressure environment for
writing that I control, I can make a habit of writing more frequently and
with less stress.

This site also gives me a place to talk about things that I find interesting
or cool, showcase my work, host a CV, and anything else I need.
